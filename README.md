- 🍁 I'm Xuefen (雪枫 in Chinese), a Ph.D. student @[Institute of Computing Technology of Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.ict.ac.cn/), received my bachelor degree@[BUPT](https://scs.bupt.edu.cn/) in the summer of 2021.
- 🌱 My research interest mainly includes `distributed ML system`, `data quality`,  `cyber security`, `AutoDrive` and `various deep learning applications`. I'm passionate about uncovering valuable & unsettled research topics, so perhaps we can collaborate to do some interesting things😆.
- 📫 You can reach me via my email: jiangxf0903@gmail.com, visit my [personal website](https://sprinter1999.github.io/website/), or view my [scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ccOCPpEAAAAJ) or [resume](https://github.com/Sprinter1999/Resume/blob/main/Xuefeng_Jiang_Resume__2024_7_ver_.pdf).
- ✨ I'm the big fan of **Iris**.
- 🌼 I love films & anime & [sightseeing](https://www.instagram.com/snowmaker1999/) & music & night & sleeping a lot. I'm also an Apex & Overwatch amateur player : )
- 😜 Thank you for your coming~

### 💬 Recent News~ ([more updates in here](https://sprinter1999.github.io/website/))
- 📕 We release one experimental study [**LLM4CVD**](https://github.com/SakiRinn/LLM4CVD) which exploits LLM to identify vulnerabilities within code.
- 🎉 Our FedCrac and [FedLF](https://github.com/18sym/FedLF) which focuses on long-tailed learning got accepted by **IEEE TMC & ACML** (~26% acceptance rate).
- 🗽 [One full research paper](https://github.com/Sprinter1999/FedELC) got accepted **@ACM/CIKM'24**, see you in [Boise](https://cikm2024.org/). We also release one related benchmark study [FNBench](https://www.techrxiv.org/users/691169/articles/1215740-fnbench-benchmarking-robust-federated-learning-against-noisy-labels).
- 🚗 We reach **top 5** teams in CVPR 2024 AutoDrive Grand Challenge ([Driving with language track](https://opendrivelab.com/challenge2024/#driving_with_language)) with offline labels and multi-modal LLM. Another work (AMD's SLAM solution for underground autonomous parking) is relased [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05017).
- ⛪ I help to initialize the website of our lab, welcome to visit [ICT-MobileComputingTeam](https://sprinter1999.github.io/ICT-MobileComputingTeam/)!
- 🎉 Our [FedNoRo](https://github.com/wnn2000/FedNoRo) which focuses on noisy&long-tailed data got accepted **@IJCAI'23** main track.
- 📚 I'm invited to serve as a reviewer for **`ICML` & `AISTATS` & `CVPR` & `WWW` & `ICLR` & `NeurIPS` & `AAAI` & `AAAI workshop` & `KDD workshop` & `ECAI` & `ICME` & `ACM TKDD` & `IEEE TKDE` & `IEEE TNNLS` & `IEEE TIV`** and help to review **`DCN`**.
